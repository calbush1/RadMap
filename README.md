# RadMap

# This contains all code used in creation of the Radiation mapping backback/ IRAD mapping software by for the University of Michigan Radiation Health Lab

# This is still a very early phase of a project. This repository will be improved once a working product is achived. 

# This was created as a way for future RHE lab students to access my code, but if you've somehow stumbled onto this feel free to use it
